generate a animated gif. on the left hand side, there is a video icon. I like to show that that video is splitted into shorts. lets say that three shorts. the long video is rectangle. a small rectangle emerges from the big rectangle and moves to the right. after that, a second rectangle emerges from the big video and it moves right too. and this is the same for the third rectangle i.e. short video. genrate a gif for this. you can use python or a different language to generate it. start
